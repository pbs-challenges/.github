## Welcome Aboard üëã

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This **pbs-students** organization is designed for folks who subscribe to the [Programming By Stealth Podcast](https://www.podfeet.com/blog/category/programming-by-stealth/). This podcast is a series of lessons taught by Bart Busschots with Allison Sheridan as the student in the front row always asking questions.

In many of the installmentes of the podcast, Bart gives the students challenges to complete in order to exercise and cement their newly acquired knowledge. This GitHub organization will allow the learners to share their work and learn from each other.

There is only one repo (so far) called pbs-challenges.  When a new member joins the organization, I will create a folder for them, and they are expected to play in their own sandbox. Of course cloning the repo will give them copies of everyone's work (which is the whole point) but we'll have to be careful not to step on anyone's toes.  There will be no pull requests either!

To join the organization contact me. If you know how to do that and can explain where you are in the Programming By Stealth series, I'll let you in.

I expect civilized behavior in this organization and since it will be filled with NosillaCastaways, I know you'll be kind, supportive, and respectful.

Allison
